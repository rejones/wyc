Generate a vCalendar file from WYC sailing events Excel file

Whitstable Yacht Club <wyc.org.uk> publishes its sailing events calendar as an Excel file (and a webpage).
wyc.pl converts the Excel file to a .vcs file suitable for importing into calendars like Apple Calendar etc.
Note that Google calendar needs VCalendar Version 2, not Version 1.
Details of use can be found in index.html
