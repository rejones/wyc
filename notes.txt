MacOS calendar does not display dates if the suffix is .ics but will if it is
.vcs!

Time Zone identifier
DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:19980119T020000
must be specified with DTSTART, DTEND, etc when value is neither UTC nor
"floating"

** easiest to use local time! I.e. without Z
  DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Londion:2020...

** DURATION might be easier than DTEND
A duration of 15 days, 5 hours, and 20 seconds would be:
       P15DT5H0M20S
or PERIOD
        19970101T180000Z/19970102T070000Z
