    <h2>How to use xl2cal</h2>
    <p>x2cal is a simple tool to convert a schedule, such as a sailing club racing calendar, 
    from a spreadsheet to an iCalendar that can be imported into Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, etc.
    </p>

<h3>1. Creating a spreadsheet for your schedule</h3>

<p>
  <em>xl2cal</em> assumes that you have created your schedule 
  in an Excel spreadsheet, with filename extension <code>.xlsx</code>.
  <br><em>More formats may be added in the future.</em>
</p>
<p>
  The layout of the spreadsheet is flexible, 
  but <em>xl2cal</em> expects to find:
  <ul>
    <li>one event per row, and</li>
  <li> columns specifying the day of the event 
    (events spanning days must be added as separate events),
    the start time of the event,
    and a name for the event.
    See section <a href="#columns">Selecting columns for export</a>
    for more detail.</li>
  </ul>
  Any row that does not look like an event is ignored. 
  Examples include heading rows, blank rows, etc.
</p>

<h3>2. Loading your spreadsheet into xl2cal</h3>

<p>
  Load your spreadsheet into <em>xl2cal</em> by either: 
  <ul>
    <li>dragging the spreadsheet file onto the landing site labelled 
    <span class="instr-landing">Drag and drop a spreadsheet file here</span> or</li>
    <li>using the <span class="instr-box">Choose file</span> button.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  By default, <em>xl2cal</em> assumes that the sheet to use is the first 
  in the spreadsheet. 
  However, you can change this with the 
  <span class="instr-box">Sheet name or number</span> box.
  Note that sheets are numbered from 0.
</p>
<p>
  You may also wish to select the calendar year for your calendar
  from the <span class="instr-box">Select Year</span> drop-down list on the left.
  The default is the current year.
</p>
<p>
  Set default duration of events with <span class="instr-box">Duration</span> box.
  Times may be hours (e.g. "2") or hours and minutes (e.g. "0:45" or "0.45").
</p>
<p>
  If you want all calendar entries to use a common prefix (such as "WYC"),
  enter it in the <span class="instr-box">Events Prefix</span> box on the right.
</p>

<h3>3. Selecting columns for export</h3>

<p>
  The cells of your spreadsheet will then be loaded into a table.
  Cells in the first row of the table are column heading buttons.
  Use these to select the columns used by your spreadsheet.
  Some columns are mandatory; others are optional.

<h4>Mandatory columns</h4>

<ol>
  <li>The date of the events must be specified by selecting<br>
      <ul>
        <li>EITHER a <strong>Day no.</strong> (number) column <i>and</i>
        a <strong>Month</strong> column,</li>
        <li>OR a <strong>Date</strong> column.</li>
      </ul>
      <em>xl2cal</em> will not allow  a <strong>Date</strong> column to be
      selected if a <strong>Day no.</strong> or a <strong>Month</strong> column
      are, and vice-versa.<br>

      If days are specified, the <strong>Day no.</strong> column may contain <i>either</i>
      cardinal (e.g. "6") <i>or</i> ordinal (e.g. "6th") numbers.<br>

      If months are specified, the <strong>Month</strong> column may contain either cardinal numbers
      (e.g. "6), or month names or prefixes (e.g. "June" or "Jun").<br>
      If a <strong>Date</strong> is specified, most Excel formats should work
      (e.g. "Saturday 1 July", "1/6/2023", etc).
  </li>

  <li>A <strong>Start</strong> column. 
      Entries in the start column should be times using a 24-hour clock.<br> 
      Acceptable entries include "1400" and "14:00". 
      Excel Time format can be used here (see under <a href="#errors">Errors</a>
      below).
      However, "TBA", "TBC", "NA" and "N/A" are also accepted.<br>
      Lines without valid Start times (such as headers, blank lines) are
      ignored.
  </li>
  <li>An <strong>Event</strong> column, describing the event.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Optional columns</h4>

These columns are optional and do not need to be selected.
<ul>
  <li>A high-water (<b>HW</b>) column.<br> 
      If this column is specified,
      any entry in this column (e.g. "1500") will be appended to the
      entry in the <strong>Event</strong> column (e.g. "Race 1" becomes "Race 1, HW=1500").
  </li>
  <li>An <b>End</b> column.<br> 
      If this column is specified, any entry in this column will be used for the
      end time of an event. 
      Otherwise, the end time will be the start time plus the duration.<br>
      Entries in the start column should be times using a 24-hour clock.<br> 
      Acceptable entries include "1400" and "14:00",
      and Excel Time format (see <a href="#errors">Errors</a> below).
  </li>
  <li>A <b>Duration</b> column.<br>
      If this column is specified, any entry in this column will be used for the
      duration of an event.
      Otherwise, the event will be given the default duration from the 
      <span class="instr-box">Duration</span> box.
      Acceptable entries include "2", "2:30" and Excel Time format
      (see <a href="#errors">Errors</a> below).
  </li>
  <li>A <b>Calendar</b> column.<br>
      This is intended to allow separate calendars to be generated from a
      single spreadsheet,
      by tagging event rows in the spreadsheet with the name of the
      appropriate calendar. 
      Before exporting an iCalendar file, the tool will ask which calendars it
      should generate entries for.
      If no Calendar column is specified, or if no calendars are selected for
      export, the iCalendar file output will contain entries for all events.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="errors">Errors</a></h4>

<p>
  Take care that dates and times are properly entered in your spreadsheet.
  In particular, 
  <ul>
  <li>If you specify a <strong>Date</strong> column, ensure that there are no missing
      spaces between words, no misspelt words.
  </li>
  <li>Be careful with Excel Date and Time formats.<br>
      Excel usually represents these as 
      the number of days since 1 January 1900 (the integral part)
      and the fraction of 24 hours (the fractional part).
      However, one Excel preference uses 1904 rather than 1900;
      avoid the 1904 format.<br>
      If you use a Date or Time format, ensure that it is for the year you want:
      Excel is quite good at using a year in the early 1900s instead!
  </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <em>xl2cal</em> will check each row in your spreadsheet.
  Any row that does not provide a valid date (however specified)
  or without a valid Start time will be ignored,
  with a warning.
  This allows you to have blank lines or other non-event rows in your
  spreadsheet.
  You have two choices if a warning pops up for a row with invalid data.
  <ul>
    <li>To continue generating your iCalendar without this row,
        click <span class="instr-box">OK</span>.</li>
    <li>to cancel generating your iCalendar,
        click <span class="instr-box">Cancel</span>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>4. Selecting the calendars to export</h3>

<p>
  Click the <span class="instr-button">Export</span> button to start to generate your calendar in 
  iCalendar format.
  This button will only be enabled (with a blue background) if you have selected sufficient
  columns. 
</p>
<p>
  If you have selected one of the columns of your spreadsheet as a "Calendars"
  column, 
  then a pop-up window will appear, 
  asking you to choose which calendar(s) to export.
  <em>xl2cal</em> will generate entries for rows with "Calendars" cells matching
  the ones you have chosen.
  If you do not choose any, 
  or if no "Calendar" column was selected,
  the iCalendar file generated will contain entries for all events.
  Click the <span class="instr-button">Export</span> button to complete
  generating your calendar.
</p>


<h3>5. Download the schedule as an iCalendar file</h3>

<p>
  When the iCalendar has been generated,
  a window will appear inviting you to download the calendar.
  This window also displays the text of the iCalendar generated.
  Click the <span class="instr-button">Download iCalendar</span> button at the top
  of the window to download the iCalendar.
  You should choose to save the iCalendar in a file with extension 
  <code>.ics</code>.
</p>
<p>
  You can then import the <code>.ics</code> file into the calendar app of your choice,
  e.g. Apple or Google Calendar. 
  To check that the calendar generated is correct, import it into a temporary 
  calendar in your app first. This is what I do on MacOS. 
  <ol>
    <li> In the calendar app, create a new calendar.</li>
    <li> Import the <code>.ics</code> file into this calendar.</li>
    <li> Check the dates and times.</li>
    <li> Delete this calendar...</li>
    <li> ...but, if the entries are all correct, merge them into 
         another calendar (e.g. I have a separate 'Sailing' calendar).</li>
  </ol>
