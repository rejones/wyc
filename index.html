<p>WYC's <a href="http://www.wyc.org.uk">webpages</a> include a
<a href="http://www.wyc.org.uk/racing/schedule">schedule</a> 
  which is great when you have access to the web.</p>
<p>But those like me who live by the calendar on their phone, PDA or desktop would like to have the schedule 
  in their pocket. So here is   a version of 
  the schedule that you can import to the calendar that you use.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Up to 2006, I used the
  <em>.dba format</em> for that I could import the schedule into the old Palm desktop on Windows. From 2007 I have been using the vCalendar format (as I've ditched Windows for
a Mac). So only a schedule in vCalendar format is provided here.
If you want the .dba version, instructions on how to build your own are given
below. If sufficient people ask me, then I'll build one
and provide it here.

<h2>For techies only</h2>

<p>Here's how I constructed the calendar. The details depend on whether you are using a modern calendar (which can import vCal) or are using the old Palm Desktop for Windows (which uses .dba  format). </p>

<p>You'll need (1) Microsoft Excel, 
  (2) Perl and, on Windows only, (3) a little tool called convdb. </p>
<ol>
  <li>First, you need  to grab the schedule from the WYC website.<br>
    Excel is very good at grabbing tables from the web (to my embarrassment, my 
    son taught me this!). Use <code>Data&gt;Import External Data&gt;New Web Query</code>, 
    type in the url (e.g. <code>http://www.wyc.org.uk/flattened/racing_schedule.html</code>) 
    and select the table you want (your mileage may vary depending on the version 
    of Excel you have).<br>
  Here's a  <a href="WYC_racing_web_query">web query</a> for Excel that I made before. 
  <br>&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>Clean the data to get rid of lines without  events, incomplete records, typos etc. From experience, you need to make sure that days and dates have not been joined together (e.g. &quot;Sun12&quot;). Brackets are probably a bad idea too - remove them. But don't introduce commas as we are going to save the file as a csv file. 
  <br>&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>Save the file as a csv file, say <code>wyc07.csv</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The rest of the procedure depends on whether you want the schedule in vCalendar format (MacOS X) or you are using the Palm desktop on Windows (.dba format) or  vCalendar is much easier.</p>

<h3>vCalendar (e.g. iCal on MacOS X, Google or Outlook on Windows)</h3>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Make sure the line breaks are correct. I have found that Excel saves csv files
  in just one long line (the curse of different newline conventions). My script likes one event per line.
  <li>Run this little Perl <a href="wyc.pl">script</a> to convert the schedule to vCalendar format. Note the extension, <code>.vcs</code>.
    You'll need to have <a href="http://www.cpan.org">Perl</a> <a href="wyc.pl"></a> installed obviously.
    <ul>
      <li><code>wyc.pl  &lt;wyc07.csv &gt;wyc07.vcs</code></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    You can also add a 
    <em>note</em> to each entry. Notes are used in the (excellent) Palm <a href="http://www.pimlicosoftware.com/">DateBk</a> calendar to format entries (e.g. with text and background colour, customised icon).<ul>
      <li>To use your own format: <code>wyc.pl -n <em>string</em> &lt;wyc07.csv &gt;wyc07.vcs</code><br>
    where <em>string</em> is the string your format needs (experiment with DateBk to see what it adds to the note field; you'll probably need to examine the note in the Palm's built-in calendar).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now import the vCalendar file into your calendar.</li>
  <li><strong>Note</strong>The file is a vCalendar Version 1.0 file. If your
  calendar (e.g. Google calendar) need Version 2.0, you'll need to convert it. I
  found that importing  into, and then exporting from. MacOS'c Calendar will do
  this.
</ol>

<h3>.dba (for Palm dateBook on Windows)  </h3>
<p>This is how you had to import data on the old Palm Desktop for Windows. The new Palm Pre can import from Google Calendar which is much simpler.</p>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Run this little Perl <a href="wyc.pl">script</a>.
    You'll need to have <a href="http://www.cpan.org">Perl</a> <a href="wyc.pl"></a> installed obviously.
    <ul>
      <li>For .dba (for Windows)<code><br>
        wyc.pl -d &lt; wyc07.csv &gt; wyc07.txt</code><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    You can also add a 
    <em>note</em> to each entry. Notes are used in the (excellent) Palm <a href="http://www.pimlicosoftware.com/">DateBk</a> calendar to format entries (e.g. with text and background colour, customised icon). There are two ways to do this:<ul>
      <li>To use your own format: <code>wyc.pl -d -n <em>string</em> &lt;wyc07.csv &gt;wyc07.txt</code><br>
    where <em>string</em> is the string your format needs (experiment with DateBk to see what it adds to the note field; you'll probably need to examine the note in the Palm's built-in calendar).<br>
    <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>There's one further step for .dba: you need to use a little tool called <code>convdb</code> to convert the text version to a Palm .dba version 
    which will be called <code>output.dba</code>. convdb. I got a copy from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Way/4696/">here</a>. 
  It's a pretty flexible if rather fragile tool for converting from plain text 
  to the Palm .dba format.
    <ul>
      <li><code>convdb -h 2 wyc07.txt</code></li>
      <li>Rename <code>output.dba</code> to something sensible, e.g. <code>wyc07.dba</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now import the dba file into the old Palm Desktop.</li>
</ol>
